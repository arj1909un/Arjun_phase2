Q1) Complete the AI showcase by progressing through all of the stages. What is the flag presented to you?
   - **flag:** `THM{AI_MANIA}`

```
Red team:
- Asked AI to generate a script to exploit the remote server 

Blue Team:
- Asked AI to analyse the logs of the attack carrier out by the python script 
  
Software:
- Reviewed the source code using AI to detect and patch vulnerabilities  
```


Q2) Execute the exploit provided by the red team agent against the vulnerable web application hosted at `10.47.173.85:5000`. What flag is provided in the script's output after it? Remember, you will need to update the IP address placeholder in the script with the IP of your vulnerable machine 
   - **flag:**  `THM{SQLI_EXPLOIT}`

After running the exploit script, I got the Output.
