#  Phishing for tbfc

## Solution:

- first we run the script so it listens to credentials.
- now we send an email to target user using SET which is designed for social engineering attacks which has many features. we configure the details of the email to be sent including a link so that target falls for the trick so yes when we open the terminal where the server is running the target user falls for the trape and 3 set of credentials are recieved
- for the next part we run the ip address and try to access using admin as factory and use the previous password to obtain the answer.
