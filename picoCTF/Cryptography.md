One of the hints of the challenge asked me to take a look at Chosen Plaintext attack:. 
#### Chosen Ciphertext Attack

Firstly, we have a piece of ciphertext we'll denote by :

```
C = t^e mod n 
```

Which is just normal RSA. What we have is normal ciphertext C. Now we can choose a plaintext, so lets say we choose 2 as our plaintext. We can now compute `Ca = 2^e mod n`. However to our program we send `Cb = Ca * C`, so now : 

```
Cb = C.2^e = (t^e*2^e) mod n 
```

Now since this is a chosen plaintext attack we're reliant on having access to the decryption of our substituted value - so now the program computes: 

```
(Cb)^d = [t^e*2^e]^d = (t^e)^d.(2^e)^d mod n 
```

However for any plaintext `x`, we know that `C = x^e` and `x = C^d`.  So: 

```
(x^e)^d = x mod n 
```

Therefore from the preceding result: 

```
(Cb)^d = t.2 mod n
```

Hence, when we get that value back, we can easily calculate `t`, but just simple halving it. 
This is possible with any integer, we took 2 here just as an example. 


#### Solve: 

So, this is how I implemented this in the given challenge: 
```

enter text to encrypt (encoded length must be less than keysize): 1

encoded cleartext as Hex m: 31

```
Here, the program accepts only characters as input, so I chose `1`, whose value in ASCII is 49, which is 0x31 in hex. therefore in the end we need to divide the hex by 0x31.  

Now we input Cb = C * Ca into the decryption program.

decrypted ciphertext as hex (c ^ d mod n): ac2c1742ee9
decrypted ciphertext:
ÂÁt.é
```

Now, we got a hex `ac2c1742ee9`, which we can now divide by `0x31` to get the final hex value, which is the original ciphertext. 


Now, `t = 0xac2c1742ee9 // 0x31 = 0x3838316439`

Now, converting this hex to ASCII, we get: `881d9`

Now this can be passed to `openssl` to decode the `secret.enc` file. 


```
> openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in secret.enc -k  881d9
