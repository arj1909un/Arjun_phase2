#  OSINT

## 1. Cornfield Chase
   I looked around and found something writtten in taiwanesse on the pole nearby and translated it after which i found the exact location was Puzi City i ssearched for nearby signs and found the exact position on google maps 
   which i coordinated to the geoguesser.
   I tried a few times before i actually got the exact location.

## 2.Bonsai Bankai
   again the image had quite a lot of clues, like the sign where it said Ming Gardens and the train station signboard. After translating and searching about the clues i found out it was the city 
   Kumamoto Chuo Ward , to get the exact location i used the street view to find the exact location and after finding it i zoomed out and tried to look for the same place in the geoguesser provided
   in the Challenge and i got my flag.


## Unfortunately these were the only challenges i could solve as i gave a lot of time to tough challenges.
